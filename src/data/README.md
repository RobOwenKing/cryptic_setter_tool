For bits and pieces the structure of each entry should be:

```
{
  "str": "A"        // The target letter or letters
  "clue": "Article" // The bits-and-pieces indicator
  "eg": "Grammar"   // Context for or explanation of the abbreviation
  "alt": "AN, THE"  // Other letter strings that clue could imply
}
```

Note that "eg" and "alt" can be deleted if unnecessary for some entry.

Template:

`{ "str": "", "clue": "", "eg": "", "alt": "" }`
