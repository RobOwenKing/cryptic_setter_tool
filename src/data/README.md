# Entry README

## How to add entries

For bits and pieces the structure of each entry should be:

```
{
  "str": "A"        // The target letter or letters
  "clue": "Article" // The bits-and-pieces indicator(s)
  "eg": "Grammar"   // Context for or explanation of the abbreviation
  "alt": "AN, THE"  // Other letter strings that clue could imply
}
```

Note that "eg" and "alt" can be deleted if unnecessary for some entry.

Template:

`{ "str": "", "clue": "", "eg": "", "alt": "" }`

## What should be included

- Standard abbreviations used in crosswords
- Short (< 4 letter) synonyms of words
- Common set phrases indicating letters
  - Yes: Maidenhead for "M", Land's End for "D", Lionheart for "IO"
  - No: Outskirts of London for "LN", as we don't want to embark on adding every city in the world
